## Usage
To run the web app, execute the Python notebook file ‚Äúmindemo2d.ipynb‚Äù. The web app is created using [Gradio](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio). For information on installing [Gradio](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio), refer to this link [https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio).

## About Mindemo
Mindemo stands for ‚Äú[Minimum Information Dependence Modeling](https://github.com/kyanostat/min-info)‚Äù. It is a highly flexible model capable of handling various interactions. In this program, we calculate probability functions using the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm for optimal transport based on the descriptions in the [Minimum Information Dependence Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.06792) paper. For models with dimensions higher than three, we implement the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm for multi-marginal optimal transport, ensuring scalability. Keep in mind that running the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm for parameter updates can be computationally intensive. Additionally, setting the step size too small may lead to convergence issues.

## Mindemo3D

We‚Äôve also created a TypeScript program called [Mindemo3D](https://github.com/tanaken-basis/mindemo3d) that visualizes a three-dimensional probability distribution constructed using the [Minimum Information Dependence Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.06792). You can experience the demo web page [here](https://tanaken-basis.github.io/mindemo3d/).

Feel free to explore the interactive visualization and see the fascinating results!üåü
